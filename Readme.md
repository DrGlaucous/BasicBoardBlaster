This repository holds the CAD files required to create one of the simplest performance nerf blasters in existence.

Currently, the only magazine type compatible with this blaster is the angled talon magazine. There are models for full size and straight talons in the CAD source files, but they are unfinished at the moment.


The only materials needed to build this blaster are:
* 3D printer
* CNC router (optional, a dremel and drill will also do just fine in a pinch with some printed vector files)
* 6x32 x 1 1/2 screws and bolts
* Small, wide rimmed plastic screw (optional, can also use a 6x32 bolt here, too)
* x4 m2 x 4mm pan head screw (for mounting motors to the cage)
* x2 hobby grade motors of choice (online vendor, [OutOfDarts](https://outofdarts.com/) is a great place to get all flywheel related hardware, including mount screws)
* x2 flywheels of choice
* lamp cord wire (or any large-gauge wire will work)
* Battery and battery connector (sized appropriately to fit your motor draw current)
* Some extension springs (couldn't tell you how long they need to be)
* Wood (I used a 9x1/2 inch x 3ft board of economy pine for mine, you could use something a bit more fancy if you want, maybe Teak?)

This build uses a 39.5mm spaced flywheel cage (shaft to shaft) with 3s "Kraken" motors and Daybreak flywheels. It hits at an average of 160 FPS.

As for assembly/wiring, please refer to the image above and this [fantastic flywheel guide](https://boilerleagueoftag.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/9/5/94957634/blts_how_to_flywheel.pdf), courtesy of the hobby club at Purdue.

Not much else to say, this thing is simple as heck.
